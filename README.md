# EasyCMS

## Why EasyCMS ?

EasyCMS seems to me as a solution and a challenge to devellop an really tiny CMS systeme. I previously use Joomla and WordPress, but both seems to complicated and to heavy for a lot of needs. More they use a lot of system ressources to generate pages. When i analyse my use of website, it seem's that we use 99% of static informations. So why use a system wich do tens of database request to display an almost static page ?

## Principes

We need a solution to easyli modify web pages, but on the front have a system with minimal resquest to do the job. My solution to this problem is linked to my knowledde of Docker and Kubernetes.
